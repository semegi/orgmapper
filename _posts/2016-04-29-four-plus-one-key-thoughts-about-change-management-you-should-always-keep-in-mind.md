Former British Prime Minister, **Benjamin Disraeli**, once said: _&#8220;Change is inevitable. Change is constant.&#8221;_, and he couldn&#8217;t have been more correct. Change, or better yet, managing change has indeed become a crucial component of a successful organization&#8217;s game plan. Without effective change management practices in place, even the best ones are set for failure.

In order to become and stay successful in managing change, here are a couple of thoughts you should always keep in mind:

  * **Change is difficult** and you shouldn&#8217;t let anyone convince you otherwise. The most difficult part is that change means shifting from the familiar to the unknown. And the unknown is scary. However, if you know how to minimize the anxiety amongst your employees, you&#8217;ll have a much better chance at succeeding. But how do you do that?
  * First of all, take it slow, because **change takes time**. You also need to **have a plan**, from start to finish, including every little detail. If you do this, and your expectations regarding completion are realistic, you might encounter less resistance.
  * Because let&#8217;s face it, **people will resist** and **not always do what they are told**. So make sure that your employees are on board and aware of the &#8220;why&#8221; and &#8220;how&#8221;, otherwise you cannot expect them to fully commit to the process.
  * Who needs to be involved in your initiative? Everyone really, **especially management**, since change must be in line with strategy, and who else other than management knows best the direction an organization wants to take. If peers **don&#8217;t see the commitment from top levels** and know their roles within the process, they quickly grow skeptical and wary of participating.

  * Last but not least, there is one more thing you shouldn&#8217;t forget. Internal communication is crucial, but it **does not equal to change management**. Consistent and constant communication is pivotal to any change program, but there is more to efficiently and effectively managing change than communications. Influencer identification for example, because if you don&#8217;t know who your most influential employees are, you will be fighting an uphill-battle.
