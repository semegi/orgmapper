Hiske isÂ joining us to oversee service delivery, as well as business- and product development related to organizational network analysis.

&#8220;With our recentÂ <a href="http://maven7network.blogspot.hu/2015/06/maven7-raises-total-of-23m-to-bring-network-science-to-commercial-mass-audience.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">round of funding</a>Â we felt the time was just right to appoint a strategic leader who can help us take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in the marketplace, and bring new insights into our operations.&#8221; â€“ said AndrÃ¡s Vicsek, Maven7&#8217;s co-founder and head of research. &#8220;We are delighted Hiske accepted our invitation.&#8221;

&#8220;I have been working with Maven7 part-time since last year as a senior business consultant&#8221; &#8211; commented Hiske, &#8220;mostly assisting clients in understanding what benefits organizational network analysis can provide for their organizations.Â Now I&#8217;m looking forward to diving in deeper and making a real impact on business objectives, whilst also growing our team of OrgMapper experts.&#8221;

Over the past 17 years Hiske has worked for multiple management consulting firms, including Accenture and PricewaterhouseCoopers, leading numerous large-scale HR projects, and is now ready to take OrgMapper forward and further expand its global reach and capabilities.

We are collectively really excited to work with her, and about the new energies, ideas, and skills she brings to the whole Maven7 team.

Welcome on board, Hiske! ðŸ™‚
