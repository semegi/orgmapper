### Our international company opened up the New Year agile. We proudly presented the first World Café by Maven7 OrgMapper involving HR and company leaders in Hungary at the beginning of January. Our main goal was to contribute to effective organizational change management.

We are living in the age of constant and speedy change: rapid development concerning technologies is there for the economic actors. These days, a <a href="http://blog.orgmapper.com/2017/01/23/operational-agility-network-research/" target="_blank">quick reflection process is essential</a> for companies which want to develop rather than just survive. In practice, it is more complicated for bigger ones than smaller ones. András Vicsek, co-founder and CEO of the international network research company Maven7 OrgMapper, said that the aim of the World Café is to give a chance for the stakeholders to share best practices in order to [speed up organizational change management processes](http://blog.orgmapper.com/2017/02/01/top-7-organizational-change-management-software/). In the first part of the event, HR and company leaders gave short inspirational presentations which were followed by the World Café rounds.

### Take a look at the future by complying with the challenges of the present

Frazír CEO and co-founder Péter Kristóf highlighted that start-up companies are capable of reaching economic advantages ahead of the multinationals by means of agile reflections. The latter do not feel they and their markets are safe due to the rapid development of technologies. Emerging start-ups are capable of quickly becoming big companies and reaching values of $ 1 billion. The number one was able to achieve their success in eight months. Giant companies are not able to keep up the speed – at least due to size.

> &#8220;The main challenge is that while the development of big companies moves on a logarithmic scale, the technology progresses exponentially. Synchronizing them is very hard – but this methodology is exactly what multinational companies can learn from start-ups,&#8221; Kristóf added.

### The question is how the big companies can keep up with the leading innovators

> &#8220;We should not be thinking about employee retention programs, but about how to make ourselves attractive among millennials. To do so, organizational agility, which is much more than agile project management is essential. It is a way of thinking. The company of the future focuses on customer needs and developing its services while improving operations at the same time. Constant learning and the ability to adapt quickly are the key factors,&#8221; said Elvira Kalmár, team leader for leadership and organizational development at Magyar Telekom.

MVM Knowledge Center expert Szabolcs Mizsei said that in five years, electro-mobility in the automotive industry is going to become the sector making the most progress globally, based on current market tendencies. Thus, exponentially developing methodology is a must in product development to organizational agility.
  
Vivien Orosz, the leader of strategic HR at MOL Group in Hungary, approached the term of organizational agility from an employer branding perspective. The main challenge for HR is that Generation Y does not always view the oil and gas industry as attractive. &#8220;Finding new employers, creating effective work methodology and knowledge transfer between different generations and making the industry more attractive for youngsters – from the aspect of agility, reactions and requirements – is a huge challenge.&#8221;

### How to involve the change agents into organizational cultural change projects?

As a responsible company, E.ON Hungary focuses on environmental changes and developing the company&#8217;s operations, and thus its culture as well. It launched an internal cultural change program which aims to strengthen the customer-focused strategy, the changes concerning the top-down communications method, and speeding up decision-making processes. They conducted pre-launch research in a cooperative program with Maven7 OrgMapper in 2010, which started with identifying the company&#8217;s opinion leaders. The 400 selected employees of the total 5000 played a massive role in identifying the focuses of the organizational cultural change program and its implementation at E.ON Hungary Group. As a result, company operations became more effective – besides launching Lean, said Tamás Kurdits, client expert for the E.ON Hungaria Center of Competence Global Learning.

> &#8220;Based on our experience, identifying key employees has an important role in company cultural change management programs, the development of customer service systems and operational tasks,” said Vicsek at the event.
