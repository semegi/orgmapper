<h3>Organizations are changing drastically in the context of digital business models and automation. We need to look at them differently now, good old orgcharts help us no more – in fact do more harm than good. What is the emerging alternative? One of them is Network analytics and visualization. Here is the essential brief on that.</h3>
<p><em>Change the way you look at things, and the things you look at will change</em>. ( Wayne Dryer)</p>

<p><strong>What do client say about it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>„Our transformation program was aimed at moving from a functional view towards an enterprise-wide approach, focusing on customer service and performance improvement. With OrgMapper we could create a platform of key employees who could involve and inform others. We were able to drive and accelerate change at all levels of the organization; understand the reaction of teams to the changes and then focus on relieving the impacts; and encourage employees to work effectively in changing contexts.</strong><strong>”</strong></p>
<p>(Telecommunications, 11 countries, 2100 employees)</p>
<p><strong>„We had over 400 influencers identified who represent every area of the business. A lot of them were employees whom management didn’t think about involving in the first place. However these colleagues prove to have very strong local networks and they can be counted on to help shape our corporate culture in every employee segment.</strong><strong>”</strong></p>
<p>(Financial Services, 1 country, 2805 employees, 2014)</p>
<p><strong>„</strong><strong>We used OrgMapper as one of the tools in our operations improvement program. Identified influencers were invited to take part in appreciativ</strong><strong>e inquiry workshops to share their ideas on how our company can be more customer focused. Because of their roles, influencers were super committed and able to spread our corporate vision quickly through their vast personal networks within the company.”</strong></p>
<p>(Energy, 1 country, 3000 employees, 2011)</p>
<p><strong>„</strong><strong>OrgMapper has helped us to engage our colleagues. The identified influencers acted as ambassadors for our ongoing cultural change.”</strong></p>
