<p>OrgMapper | Insights is back with a new video, in which, <strong>Hiske den Boer, Director at OrgMapper</strong>, talks about organizational culture change and its effects on the established social arrangements for doing work.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghWx6qrSIsA]</p>
<p><strong>Key Learning points of this episode:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Organizational culture change is <strong>not a technical change</strong>, like a systems implementation or redesign of work processes</li>
<li>Culture change <strong>significantly impacts</strong> human relationships within your company</li>
<li>By mapping your organization's informal networks, you can <strong>identify local role models and influencers</strong> who can be successfully deployed to support and accelerate your culture change programs</li>
</ul>
