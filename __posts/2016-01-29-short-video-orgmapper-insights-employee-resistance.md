OrgMapper | Insights is back with a new video, in which **Hiske den Boer**, Business Unit Director of OrgMapper, talks about employee resistance to change and how it can be overcome by involving employees in the change process from an early stage.

Key Learning points of this episode:

  * Employee resistance is often **not against the change itself**, but the way it is implemented.
  * The involvement of employees in the change process helps to **minimize resistance.**
  * By mapping your organization&#8217;s informal employee networks, you can identify your key influencers along with their communication and collaboration paths, and **get them to participate** in your change initiatives early on in order to ensure a successful transition.
