Three weeks ago, in collaboration with Diktio Labs, we published an article identifying <a href="http://blog.orgmapper.com/2015/10/22/what-the-change-management-community-looks-like-on-twitter-mini-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the top key opinion leaders in change management</a> on Twitter. **Mike Lehr** was named #1 KOL, and now we are delighted to announce that he will be the guest speaker at our upcoming Change Management webinar.

  <strong>Change Management webinar – December 1, 4PM CET (10 AM EST)</strong>

In this webinar Mike and our Head of Research, András Vicsek, will be discussing how hidden influencers can drive culture change, and how they can be identified with the power of organizational network analysis. Join us for an hour and learn how to design a shorter, cleaner, transparent, and successful change program for employees, HR and top management alike.
