Just a few days ago, we launched <a href="http://blog.orgmapper.com/2016/02/23/introducing-the-new-orgmapper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a brand new OrgMapper</a>, and in a week&#8217;s time, we are running our first Change Management webinar of the year to showcase how it helps you tackle organizational challenges.
  
**András Vicsek**, OrgMapper&#8217;s Head of Research, will be joined by Organization Architect, **Leandro Herrero,** to discuss maximizing the effects of change initiatives through influencer involvement.
