You already know that with **OrgMapper | INFLUENCE** you can identify your most motivated and capable influential employees; those best fitted to take on the roles of change agents and accelerate your change management initiatives. By now you are also aware of [the most suitable organizational scenarios you can deploy these influencers in](http://blog.orgmapper.com/2016/07/05/elect-empower-enhance-top-3-influencer-involvement-scenarios/). However, one question remains as you are about to embark on a new change or development program: how do you incorporate your influencers into your strategies?

**First of all, what do influencers really do?** 

  * build internal awareness
  * share expertise
  * build capability

But that&#8217;s not all. They also focus their efforts on the effects of changes in technologies, structures, or processes on interpersonal and group relationships in the organization. So, **an influencer&#8217;s primary role is to assist in managing impact, the impact of change.**

In order to make sure that influencer involvement is as effective as possible, change managers will have to consider **three crucial factors when putting together their influencer deployment strategy: **group make-up, clear roles, and collaboration structure.

<span style="color: #f92c49;"><strong>1. Group make-up</strong></span>
  
Influencers can be involved in the following key parts of the change management process:

  1. functional requirements
  2. impact assessment
  3. communications
  4. training
  5. change readiness

The more diverse the group of influencers, the broader the adoption and reach of the program across the workforce. Furthermore, **varied experience brings valuable knowledge and feedback** into the program.

<span style="color: #f92c49;"><strong>2. Clear roles</strong></span>

It is absolutely vital to make sure your influencers have a clear understanding about their roles within the transition project. Ask them to **help in shaping and making it their own**. This way, they&#8217;ll be able to:

  * assist in implementing solutions
  * help solve problems (facilitation)
  * share your knowledge and information (communication)
  * educate and build capability (training)
  * track what has been done and what still needs to be accomplished (reporting)

<span style="color: #f92c49;"><strong>3. Collaboration structure</strong></span>

Do you know in what work settings your newly identified influencers are most effective? Through what channels and in what structure do they like to communicate and collaborate with their colleagues?

  * Should you unite your influencers in **centralized groups**?
  
    That way they will know each other, support each other and work towards the common goal whilst reporting directly to the program manager.
  * Or are they better off working in **sub groups within units with different hierarchy levels?
  
** They could report to the change sponsor of that unit, who would then report to the program manager.
  * Perhaps they are most effective **working on their own?**
  
    That way they can work in their own teams and work environment.

Whichever structure you decide to go with, one thing is certain, it is vital to to use current and well known communication structures.

All in all, finding influencers is crucial, but knowing where they fit into your strategy is even more so. Whether it is a large-scale change program or an initiative to boost employee engagement, OrgMapper enables organizations to find their key influencers and improve their internal communications.
