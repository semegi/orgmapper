OrgMapper | Insights is back with a new video, in which, **Hiske den Boer, Director at OrgMapper**, talks about organizational culture change and its effects on the established social arrangements for doing work.



**Key Learning points of this episode:**

  * Organizational culture change is **not a technical change**, like a systems implementation or redesign of work processes
  * Culture change **significantly impacts** human relationships within your company
  * By mapping your organization&#8217;s informal networks, you can **identify local role models and influencers** who can be successfully deployed to support and accelerate your culture change programs
