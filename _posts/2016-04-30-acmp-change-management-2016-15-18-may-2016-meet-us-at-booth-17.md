In two weeks&#8217; time the OrgMapper team will be _en route_ to Dallas, to participate at the <a href="http://acmpconference.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACMP Change Management Conference</a> as Silver Sponsors.

We are thrilled to be bringing our unique network approach to this year&#8217;s event and we would love to meet you there. You&#8217;ll be able to find us at **Booth #17** in the Exhibition Hall, where you can ask us about the unique way OrgMapper | INFLUENCE identifies key influencers within organizations, and learn about the characteristics of these influential employees.
