### Organizations are changing drastically in the context of digital business models and automation. This means we need to look at them differently now, and good old orgcharts no longer help us – in fact, they do more harm than good. What is the emerging alternative? One is network analytics and visualization, and here is the essential brief.

#### **What is ONA?** 

Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) is an emerging new method which is based on network science and sociometric research – a quantitative method for measuring and visualizing social relationships in organizations.

#### **What is OrgMapper for?  An organizational change management tool to accelerate change and organizations.**

OrgMapper | INFLUENCE is a global market leading tool, which Maven7 Inc. has developed (See Gartner Research G00298878, Market Guide for Social Network Analysis Published: 19 July 2016). It comes with a built-in methodology for analyzing large data sets and generating clear visualizations for complex organizations. It also accommodates every employee, hierarchy level, location and business unit. More than 300 organizations have used it, and over 70 certified consultants world-wide do so currently.

#### **Why use it?  Business benefits of OrgMapper | INFLUENCE**

The typical business benefits expected from projects include (1) accelerated change/transformation projects with faster lead times, (2) cost saving from more targeted communications effectiveness and (3) more employee alignment with business objectives. That translates into better advocacy and engagement metrics. Recently, more focus is put on using OrgMapper to support (4) digital organization design and transformation, creating more agile virtual organizational structures. Other potential usage patterns come in the attached Case Reference document, including other potential outcome focuses.

#### **How does it look in practice?  OrgMapper | INFLUENCE in action** 

Our <a href="http://orgmapper.com/when/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analytics projects</a> have a typical duration of 4-12 weeks, depending on population size and complexity. They use a secure online interface with a short preference survey to produce interactive online results and narrative insight. The core is a peer-driven preference process to identify the organization’s most influential (acknowledged, capable, and motivated) employees, or “collaborates”, making it easy to engage them in business transformation.

#### **How much it costs typically?  Let&#8217;s talk about the dirty numbers**

Project pricing is based on participant license fees, depending on organizational size and complexity. The price varies from $9 to $1.20 per participant with a typical investment range from $10k-$50k. Please note that it does not include analytics-driven consulting or management action. Project and client references are available – at <a href="http://orgmapper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">orgmapper.com</a>
