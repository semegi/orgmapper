On March 8, **András Vicsek**, our Co-founder and Head of Research, hosted OrgMapper&#8217;s first change management webinar of the year, titled _&#8220;Maximize the Effects of Your Change Initiatives Through Influencer Involvement&#8221;_. András was joined by thought leader in change management and organizational architect, **Leandro Herrero.**

The webinar kicked off with a poll, asking the audience about their opinion on why change initiatives in 2016 still fail. **According to 69%** of attendees, failure can be attributed to employees not fully understanding the need for change.

András and Leandro discussed the **importance of shifting** organizational focus from processes and systems **to employee behaviors** during times of change, and outlined that **hierarchical influence is mostly over-estimated**, with peer-to-peer influence being the true engine of organizations.

A case study about knowledge-hubs within an organization, and how they were **utilized during a successful SAP implementation process**, was presented, and it was also highlighted that peer-elected **influential employees will always be your best change agents** aiding your initiatives, as acknowledgement by their colleagues will immediately result in motivation and commitment.

The webinar concluded with listing key influencer characteristics and discussing **the role of stories in accelerating change**, and shaping an organization&#8217;s culture.

All in all, the key learnings of the webinar were that **social influence in the workplace is now more valuable than formal positions**, and properly identified and empowered influencers will drive your change programs to success. Make sure you consider these in your next projects and you are destined to succeed.
