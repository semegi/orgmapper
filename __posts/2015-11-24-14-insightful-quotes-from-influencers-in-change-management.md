A little over a month ago, in collaboration with our Diktio Labs division, we published a list of the <a href="http://orgmapper.com/2015/10/22/what-the-change-management-community-looks-like-on-twitter-mini-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most influential change management Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs)</a> on Twitter, and now we are bringing you first-hand insights from some of the experts identified by our mini research.

Mike Lehr, Andre’ D. Harrell, Braden Kelley and Malati Marlene Shinazy were kind enough to share their thoughts on current and future trends, best practices, and essential components of a successful change management initiative.

_**2)** &#8220;Advancements in technology and research methodologies are driving this in two ways. __One is the huge advancements in the study of **human behavior** that will allow us to leverage these relationships better. __The other is the accelerating ability to quantify and monitor these relationships.&#8221;_ 

_**3)** &#8220;We are in the midst of a human-data **revolution**.&#8221; [<img class="" src="/images/2015/11/tweet-graphic-4.png" alt="Tweet: " width="79" height="27" />](http://ctt.ec/KSoaf)_

**Andre’ D. Harrell
  
** _<img class=" wp-image-347 alignleft" src="/images/2015/11/copy-of-we-are-in-the-midst-of-a-human-data-revolution-al-1.jpg" alt="Copy of We are in the midst of a human-data revolution.al (1)" width="237" height="237" />**4)** &#8220;&#8216;Change Management&#8217; will be the result of &#8216;Behavioral Modification&#8217; where **value** to the individual impacted by the change will **supersede** the actual act of change.&#8221;_

_**5)** &#8220;There will be more of an effort to place value on the purpose of change, which will allow for more **empowerment** and **acceptance** towards change.&#8221; [<img class="" src="/images/2015/11/tweet-graphic-4.png" alt="Tweet: There'll be more of an effort to place value on the purpose of change, which will allow for more empowerment and acceptance towards change." width="78" height="27" />](http://ctt.ec/dbJa2)_

_**6)** &#8220;You’ll see an increase in leadership competencies where those in positions of power will have to be nimble, flexible, humble and importantly **strategic** in communicating and **inspiring** a vision that brings a sense of value to change.&#8221;_

_**7)** &#8220;Change Agents who are effective at communicating a “Vision” that aligns to the needs and value of others affected by the change, will ALWAYS garner **support** and **acceptance**.&#8221;_

_**8)** &#8220;Removing the complexities of ambiguity that often impairs change can be conquered by those who can communicate and lead by example a vision that inspires and reinforces the **positivity of change**.&#8221;_

**Braden Kelley
  
** _<img class=" wp-image-346 alignleft" src="/images/2015/11/copy-of-copy-of-we-are-in-the-midst-of-a-human-data-revolution-al-1.jpg" alt="Copy of Copy of We are in the midst of a human-data revolution.al (1)" width="233" height="233" />9) &#8220;In today&#8217;s environment it is **innovate** or die, and the reason that most organizations are bad at innovation is that they are bad at change.&#8221; [<img class="" src="/images/2015/11/tweet-graphic-4.png" alt="Tweet: " width="78" height="27" />](http://ctt.ec/J_Nea)_

_10) &#8220;So, the ability to create a culture of continuous change in an organization, and a commitment to **empowering employees** with the tools, techniques, and mindsets that lead to the creation of a new organizational capability in change for the organization, will lead to THE most important competitive advantage an organization could possibly possess - greater organizational agility.&#8221;_

_11) &#8220;Successful change leadership teams build a **clear plan** that can be easily shared in order to start creating movement, in order to overcome the inertia of the organization, and then they focus on building and sustaining the momentum necessary to realize the desired transformation, whether that is a &#8220;BIG C&#8221; change or a &#8220;little c&#8221; change.&#8221;_

**Malati Marlene Shinazy, MEd**_
  
<img class=" wp-image-523 alignleft" src="/images/2015/11/copy-of-copy-of-we-are-in-the-midst-of-a-human-data-revolution-al.png" alt="Copy of Copy of We are in the midst of a human-data revolution.al" width="237" height="237" />12) &#8220;Change in any part of a system impacts all elements of that system: Products, Processes and most importantly People. The **impact** of each of these elements must be considered before a change initiative is engaged and then continually during the change management process.&#8221;_

_13) &#8220;People are the stakeholders of change. Employees, customers, investors, and vendors are all **impacted** by organizational changes.&#8221;_ [<img class=" alignnone" src="/images/2015/11/tweet-graphic-4.png" alt="Tweet: " width="79" height="27" />](http://ctt.ec/6Qokf)

_14) &#8220;Human resources leaders should be partners to the change management team, as they can identify how change will impact internal stakeholders. They can also identify the degree and type of timely communication it will take to get and keep employees on-board with the change and the degree to which the organization has the bench strength to undertake the change **successfully**.&#8221;_
