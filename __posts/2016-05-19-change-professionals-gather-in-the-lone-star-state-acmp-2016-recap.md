After four amazing days, 11,225 miles traveled and some serious jet lag, Team OrgMapper wants to thank everyone at ACMP Change Management 2016 in Dallas. This year&#8217;s conference was the 6th edition of the annual gathering, welcoming **22 exhibitors** and over **1,100 change management professionals,** and we were delighted to meet hundreds of them at our booth.

We were intrigued and inspired by all the questions we received from our visitors, and we can proudly say that the feedback for **<a href="http://www.orgmapper.com/influence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OrgMapper | INFLUENCE</a>** has been incredible.

As we believe in the power of networks, it was only natural to showcase it live. In order to do this, we monitored Twitter activity around #ACMP2016 and showed the results real-time.

Twitaholics could see their handles pop up in the network of opinion leaders. What does that mean? It&#8217;s basically showing how attendees have interacted with one another in the discussions around #ACMP2016.

We also showed other topics, hashtags to be exact, mentioned the most together with **#ACMP2016**, which revealed that conference attendees talked a lot about **#diversity, #agile, #changemanagement** and of course the future, namely **#ACMP2017**.

Once again, Team OrgMapper wants to thank everyone, who expressed interest in our tool and we look forward to what the future holds as well as ACMP Change Management 2017 in New Orleans!
