After hundreds of work hours and dozens of sleepless nights, we are extremely proud and thrilled to present to you a **<span style="color: #f92c49;">brand new, completely re-imagined and re-calibrated OrgMapper</span>**.

It is time to say farewell to the familiar blue and orange colors, as we have executed a full redesign of the brand, not just the tool. Let&#8217;s see OrgMapper&#8217;s new developments:

  * more robust system to accommodate **30,000+ organizations** &#8211; number of survey respondents technically unlimited
  * more complex and **sophisticated change agent selection**, based on latest advances in network science
  * clear and comprehensible **&#8216;theater gram&#8217; visualization** of complex data for large-scale projects
  * automated reporting system with **comprehensive narrative report** to present project outcomes

<span style="color: #f92c49;"><br /> <strong>New features, more powerful insights, new design</strong></span>
  
Developed in the spirit of **continuous improvement**, with customer and partner feedback in mind, the new OrgMapper offers **greater flexibility, transparency** and **better functionality**. Thanks to our scientific advances, the tool now presents **actionable results** in the form of a comprehensive narrative report, whilst also maximizing user experience on a redesigned interface.

# Influence & Excellence

With the debut of **<span style="color: #f92c49;">OrgMapper | INFLUENCE</span>**, previously known as ChangeMapper, we have opened a new chapter in providing never-before-available insights to organizations looking to **drive change management, improve internal communications** or **boost employee engagement**, by revealing their hidden influencers.

This chapter is far from finished, as we continue to put our tried and tested methodologies into practice with the development of **<span style="color: #f92c49;">OrgMapper | EXCELLENCE</span>**, the successor of our PerformanceMapper tool, that will focus on boosting business performance.
